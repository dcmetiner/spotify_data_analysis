# Spotify Song & Genre Analysis, Popularity Prediction and Building a Simple Recommendation System

Welcome to our project about analyzing Spotify Data as a part of Sabanci University CS210 Introduction to Data Science course. We conducted our work through 3 main steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing
- Machine Learning

In the exploratory data analysis, first we analyzed the features of the whole data, commenting on our findings afterwards. Later on, we compared the features with each other and also throughout the years. Afterwards, we continued with the analysis of the 1000 most popular tracks and comparison of their features with the whole data. We continued with the popularity changes of genres over time and the temporal analysis of the features of the most popular genres. We concluded this step of our project with the analysis of post-COVID track features. 

We continued with the hypothesis testing step after exploratory data analysis. We made tests on our data to see the effect of features on the popularity of the songs and if significant differences exist between different eras. 

Lastly, in the machine learning part, first we used linear regression models in order to predict the popularity of a song. We continued with hyper-parameter tuning to increase the effectiveness. We used random forest and decision tree models to model our data and aimed to reach the maximum accuracy. We concluded our project by developing a simple song recommendation system, accepting a list of songs as an input and returning 3 similar songs for each entered song.

You can explore our findings through the Jupyter Notebooks provided under the project.
